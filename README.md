# Shorty-URL-Shortener
Shorty - URL shortener, is used to generate shorter aliases for prolonged URLs. Users are redirected to the authentic URL when they hit these brief links. URLs can get long, unattractive, and break when sent via e-mail. To shorten an Internet address, we proposed a secure URL shortening service that will take a long Web address and create a shorter address that will not break in an e-mail posting and elsewhere. Short links save a lot of space when displayed, printed, messaged, or tweeted. Additionally, users are less likely to mistype shorter URLs.  Some of the 0ther features include User Authentication and Authorization, Expiry Time of Userâ€™s choice for the Shortened links, and a Dedicated Dashboard to keep a track of all the Shortened URLs.
